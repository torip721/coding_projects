            <h3>Types of Cats</h3>
            <p>Cats come in many different types, each with their own unique look and personality. Domestic cats are often divided into purebred breeds, like the fluffy Persian known for its long coat and calm nature, or the sleek Siamese with striking blue eyes and a loud, talkative voice. Maine Coons are one of the largest types of cats, famous for their bushy tails and gentle temperaments. Bengal cats stand out with their wild, leopard-like spots and energetic personalities. On the other hand, Sphynx cats are hairless, making them eye-catching and known for being affectionate lap cats. Some people simply refer to mixed-breed cats as “moggies” or domestic shorthairs and longhairs, which come in every color and pattern imaginable. Beyond breeds, cats are often grouped by coat types, such as tabby, calico, or solid colors. No matter the type, each cat brings its own charm, making them one of the most diverse and beloved pets in the world.</p>
