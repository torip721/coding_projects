      <h4>Why I love Gilmore Girls</h4>
      <p>
        I love <em>Gilmore Girls</em> because of the comforting vibes it gives off. If I had to pick a comfort show this would be it! I love the jokes, the pop culture references, and the strong complex relationships. I have never seen such laid out, perfectly portrayed, raw characters. They had a small budget, but they really showed off with their acting and commitment to the show. I definitely recommend watching this show! If you're watching for the first time, watch it in the fall for the best experience!
